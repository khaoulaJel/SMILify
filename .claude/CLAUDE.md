# SMILify

3D (animal) model fitting and neural inference framework, based on SMALify. Supports arbitrary rigged 3D models (during developement focused on insects and mice) with single-view and multi-view reconstruction.

## Environment

- Ubuntu 24.04 as well as Windows 11, Python via conda (miniconda3 installed via scoop)
- Conda env: `pytorch3d` (Python 3.10, CUDA 11.8). Recommended: PyTorch 2.3.1 / pytorch3d 0.7.8 (Windows dev + run.ai Linux cluster; pytorch3d has a `cu118_pyt231` build). A local Linux box also runs 2.1.1 / 0.7.7. See `environment.yml`.
- Conda executable: `C:/Users/Fabian/scoop/apps/miniconda3/current/Scripts/conda.exe`
- Cannot run conda/python directly from bash shell - shell hook setup is needed
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed

## Architecture

Two fitting approaches share the same `smal_model` (SMAL/SMIL parametric model):

- **Optimization-based** (`smal_fitter/fitter.py`): `SMALFitter` is an `nn.Module` that optimizes per-frame pose, shape (betas), translation, and FOV via gradient descent. Losses: 2D joint reprojection, silhouette, beta prior, pose prior, joint limits, splay. Supports both legacy quadruped priors (`use_unity_prior`) and arbitrary rigged models (`config.ignore_hardcoded_body`) with per-joint scaling.
- **Neural inference** (`smal_fitter/neuralSMIL/`): Learned regressors that predict SMIL parameters from images (single-view or multi-view).

Key globals from `config.py` used throughout: `N_BETAS`, `N_POSE`, `CANONICAL_MODEL_JOINTS`, `ignore_hardcoded_body`, `dd` (model dict), `DEBUG`.

## Config System (config-refactor branch)

- Precedence: CLI args > JSON file > mode-specific defaults > base defaults > legacy config.py
- JSON configs must include `"mode": "singleview"` or `"mode": "multiview"`
- Curriculum learning dicts use string keys in JSON, auto-converted to int on load

## How to Build / Test

- Install deps: `conda env create -f environment.yml && conda activate pytorch3d` (there is no requirements.txt; the conda env is authoritative)
- Run all tests: `pytest`
- Run fast tests only: `pytest -m "not slow"`

## Conventions

- Use dataclasses for new configuration
- Keep legacy `config.py` working for backward compatibility with fitter_3d
- Unify functionality and flag repeated code when applicable, as duplicate functions exist from earlier developement stages

## Diagnostics & Validation

These are rules for Claude, derived from past first-cut bugs and premature cleanups on this project.

- **Probe before editing.** Before any edit that depends on data shape, channel ordering, dtype, or a struct/config attribute, read the actual artifact (sample file, dataclass definition, function signature) and state the concrete fact in the response before writing. Past misses on this repo: cv2.imread depth swap assuming R=G=B with BGR ordering, helper using `action_dim` off the wrong EnvConfig, sign-flipped canonical-frame projection.
- **Verify byte-equivalence on I/O swaps.** When swapping I/O libraries (cv2 ↔ PIL ↔ imageio), check channel order and dtype explicitly — don't trust that "an image is an image."
- **Add empirical probes on data-pipeline changes.** Round-trip equivalence checks, per-view visualizations, and projection sanity asserts go in alongside the change, not after the user asks. Be explicit about producing these elements and review them with feedback from the user.
- **Verify that a checkpoint actually loaded before trusting anything downstream.** Assert zero
  missing and zero unexpected keys (`load_state_dict(..., strict=True)`), and additionally compare
  one named tensor against the raw file after loading. This is its own failure class, distinct from
  the proxy-vs-mechanism pattern: the experiment never touches what it claims to, fails *silently*,
  and emits a believable result. Caught 2026-08-28 in `circumferential_feature_probe_20260828.py`,
  where weights stored under `model_state_dict` were looked up as `model`, `strict=False` matched
  **nothing** (178 missing keys), and a randomly initialised network produced a plausible
  "signal at sa1, lost by fp1" pattern. A non-zero-weight check does **not** catch this, because
  random weights are non-zero.
- **Preserve diagnostic artifacts.** Scratch scripts, probe outputs, and comparison plots stay on disk under a clearly-named path (`diagnostics/`, `*_PROBE.*`) until the user has reviewed them and signaled OK. No same-turn cleanup.
