"""Runner for hierarchical part-anchored registration (M1).

Schedule, and why it is in this order:

  H0_body      Fit ONLY the body chain (thorax, gaster, head, mandibles, antennae) with a
               GLOBAL chamfer. Legs are frozen. The body is three blobs on an axis and is
               essentially unimodal, so this places the template reliably and, critically,
               places the six coxae -- which is what makes the leg partition meaningful.
  H1_legs      Freeze the body, partition the target by anatomical territory, and fit each
               leg chain against ONLY its own assigned target points. This is the step that
               removes the six-identical-legs multimodality.
  H2_joint     Unfreeze everything, keep the partition. Global refinement that can still
               not reward a leg for matching another leg's surface.
  H3_deform    Optional small free-form pass with an offset penalty, to absorb genuine
               species-specific detail the parametric model cannot express -- NOT to hide
               pose error. Offsets are expensive here by construction.
